**Hi, I am Linyc. Welcome to my blog ,here is my work experience.**

I am a programmer and I enjoy what I am doing, so that is the reason I selected Software Developing as my major in college.

In July 2009, I graduated from Guangdong Mechanical & Electrical College. Moreover, I already had 3 months practicing experience before graduate.

From August 2009 to December 2011, I was working in a software company and completed many projects by myself. A lot projects are required to use `C#.Net` to develop and most of projects were in WinForm Framework. I am an expert of `C#.Net` and `WinForm` Framework. Importantly, I am also expert at `Asp.Net` Framework.

From December 2011 to May 2013, I worked in an E-Commerce(B2B2C) company and my job was to develop a background program a powerful tool helping business to upload data of product and arrange them in order.

From May 2013 to August 2013, I worked in a E-Commerce(B2C) company and developed some tools to help the operation of personal business.

In August 2013, I took a vacation and travelled round the China. After the vacation, in October 2013, I run an online business on the `taobao.com`. In May 2014, I started to learn the `iOS` developing and published two apps on the `AppStore` success.

*Now, I really enjoy the `iOS` developing and hope I can work in a related company and especially a mobile developing company. Anyway, If you have any question and feel free to contact me.*
